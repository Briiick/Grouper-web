# Grouper

We are a virtual meeting space for people to interact with each other through instantaneously generated, private video chats.

Tired of hosting an event online and not being able to have a 1-on-1 conversation with someone separate from the main discussion?

Grouper is a virtual social space. Control your avatar and move next to other people's avatars. As soon as you do, a video channel is created for you to interact.

Grouper is great for parties, events, and other social occasions where the barriers are too high to meet in-person. We make personal video calls easy, inspired by the way people socialize in real life.
